# Question 30: Choose and Justify Data Structures for a Real-World System Design Scenario (Like a Social Network’s Feed)

Designing the **feed** for a social network is a complex task that requires careful selection of data structures to
ensure scalability, performance, and user satisfaction. The feed must efficiently handle a vast amount of data, provide
quick access to relevant content, and support various operations such as insertion, deletion, and real-time updates.

While **Graph** data structures are indeed a strong candidate for representing relationships in social networks, several
other data structures can be employed either independently or in combination to optimize different aspects of the feed
system. Below, we explore multiple data structures, their applications, advantages, and potential drawbacks in the
