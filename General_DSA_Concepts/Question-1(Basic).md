### Question 1: Explain Big-O Notation 

Big O notation is a mathematical concept used in computer science to describe the efficiency of algorithms, particularly 
in terms of their time and space (memory) requirements. It provides a high-level understanding of how an algorithm's resource usage grows relative to the size of its input
