### Question 10: Explain Big-O Notation 

#### Definition
_Linear Data Structures_:
* Definition: Elements are arranged in a sequential order, where each element is connected to its previous and next element.
* Structure: Single-level, one-dimensional arrangement.

_Non-Linear Data Structures_:
* Definition: Elements are arranged in a hierarchical manner, where each element can be connected to multiple elements.
* Structure: Multi-level, multi-dimensional arrangement.

#### Characteristics

| **Aspect**            | **Linear Data Structures**                     | **Non-Linear Data Structures**                      |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Organization**      | Sequential order                               | Hierarchical or networked relationships             |
| **Traversal**         | One after another (e.g., left to right)        | Multiple paths and levels                           |
| **Memory Utilization**| Contiguous memory allocation (often)           | Non-contiguous memory allocation                    |
| **Implementation**    | Simpler to implement                           | More complex to implement                           |
| **Flexibility**       | Less flexible in representing complex relationships | Highly flexible for representing complex relationships |
| **Examples**          | Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues           | Trees, Graphs                                       |
