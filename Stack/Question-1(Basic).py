# Question 1: Explain the concept of a stack and its basic operations (push, pop, peek).

"""
Think of it like a container with a single opening. The last item you put in is the first one you can take out.
Here are the essential operations of a stack:
    Push: This operation adds an element to the top of the stack. Think of it as placing a new plate on top of the stack of plates.
    Pop: This operation removes the element from the top of the stack. It's like taking the topmost plate off the stack.
    Peek (or Top): This operation allows you to look at the element at the top of the stack without removing it. You're just checking which plate is on top without taking it off.

Why are stacks useful?
Stacks are incredibly versatile and used in various scenarios:
    Function Calls:  When you call a function in a program, the system uses a stack to keep track of the function calls. Each function call is "pushed" onto the stack, and when a function returns, it's "popped" off.
    Undo/Redo: Many applications use stacks to implement undo and redo functionality. Each action is pushed onto the stack, and when you undo, the last action is popped.
    Expression Evaluation: Stacks can be used to evaluate arithmetic expressions, especially those written in postfix or prefix notation. 1  Â
