# Question 29: Implement a lazy propagation min-heap for segment-like queries.
"""
Implementing a full lazy propagation min-heap is quite involved and typically relies on a tree-like structure (similar to a segment tree) rather than a simple array-based heap. The core idea is to defer updates to ranges until they are absolutely necessary.

Structure: You'd typically build a binary tree representing the ranges (like a segment tree). Each node in the tree represents a range of the original data.
Lazy Updates: When an update is applied to a range, instead of updating every element in that range, you store the update information (the "lazy" value) at the node representing that range.
Propagation: The lazy update is "pushed down" to the children of a node only when a query or further update requires accessing the elements within that node's range.
Min-Heap Property: The min-heap property needs to be maintained, considering the pending lazy updates.


class LazyPropagationMinHeap:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.size = size
        self.tree = [float('inf')] * (4 * size)  # Tree to store values
        self.lazy = [0] * (4 * size)            # Tree to store lazy updates

    def _push(self, node):
        # Propagate lazy update to children
        if self.lazy[node] != 0:
            self.tree[2 * node] += self.lazy[node]
            self.lazy[2 * node] += self.lazy[node]
            self.tree[2 * node + 1] += self.lazy[node]
            self.lazy[2 * node + 1] += self.lazy[node]
            self.lazy[node] = 0
